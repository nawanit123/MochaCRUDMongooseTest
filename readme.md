# Testing Mocha JS over Mongoose CRUD queries

## Features
1. Using Mocha JS to test code in development environment.
2. Added mocha script to package.json. To run the test simply run the script "test" using "npm run test".
3. Use of ES6 promises over Mongoose Promises.
4. Implemented testing for all the **CRUD**(Create,Read, Update & Delete) functionality of Mongoose Queries.
5. Used native assertion library of Node JS.

## Reasons to create this project
1. Learning to write better and functional code in development environment.
2. Understanding Mocha JS and its flow for executing test files.
3. In-depth understanding of Mongo queries.

## Features to add in forseeable future
1. Importing and testing external assertion libraries such as "BlueJ", "Chai" etc.
