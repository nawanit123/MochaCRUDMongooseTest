# Testing Mocha JS over Mongoose CRUD queries

## Features
1. Using Mocha JS to test Mongoose code in testing environment.
2. Added mocha script to package.json. To run the test simply run the script "test" using "npm run test".
3. Use of ES6 promises over Mongoose Promises.
4. Implemented testing for all the **CRUD**(Create,Read, Update & Destroy) functionality of Mongoose Queries.
5. Used native assertion library of Node JS.

## Reasons to create this project
1. Learning to write better and functional code in test environment.
2. Understanding Mocha JS and its flow for executing test files.
3. In-depth understanding of Mongo queries and operators.

## Features to add in forseeable future
1. Importing and testing external assertion libraries such as "BlueJ", "Chai" etc.
